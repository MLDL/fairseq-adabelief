2020-10-24 01:53:49 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example hypothesis: luckily, the mother is still the invention, and a large part of the design work that we stumble on our airplane has been a result of having to solve the unique problems associated with operating on the ground -- everything from a continuously variable propulsion and a cooling system that allows us to use an airplane in stop and go traffic to a specially appropriate vehicle that drives the propeller either, or the ground, or if you're on the highway to the highway, if you're on the ground, you'll see the highway trading aircraft, to the falling system, to the falsibility.
2020-10-24 01:53:49 | INFO | fairseq.tasks.translation | example reference: fortunately, necessity remains the mother of invention, and a lot of the design work that we're the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground -- everything from a continuously-variable transmission and liquid-based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop-and-go traffic, to a custom-designed gearbox that powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground, to the automated wing-folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment, to crash safety features.
